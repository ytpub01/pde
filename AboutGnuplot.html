<h2 class="style1">Gnuplot For Windows </h2>
<hr>
<p>Gnuplot for windows is a windows implementation of the gnuplot unix/linux application package. </p>
<p>From the "<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/faq/faq.html">Gnuplot FAQ page</a>"one reads that </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function
plotting program. It can be used to plot functions and data points in
both two- and three-dimensional plots in many different formats. It is
designed primarily for the visual display of scientific data. gnuplot
is copyrighted, but freely distributable; you don't have to pay for it.
"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gnuplot is useful for visualizing one and two dimensional data sets
and can create line and surface plots in forms that are very similar to
those created with Matlab. The <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/faq/faq.html">Gnuplot FAQ page</a> is a good reference. It is also useful to look at the gnuplot <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/">demonstration page</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">Gnuplot information site</a> provides information on how to obtain it. To save you the bother of locating the download site, I've made a copy of <a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/%7Eanderson/269b.1.07w/Support/gp400win32.zip">gp400win32.zip</a>
that you can download by clicking on the link. All you need to do is
unzip the file, and then click on the wgnuplot.exe file in the
gnuplot/bin directory. </p>
