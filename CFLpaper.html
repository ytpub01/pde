<B>Hyperbolic Difference Equations: A Review of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy Paper in the Light of Recent Developments<BR>
	by P. D. Lax</B><BR>
	<BR>
The portion of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy paper [Math. Ann. 100, 32 (1928)] that was devoted to hyperbolic difference
equations is critically reviewed in terms of its basic contribution to the numerical solution of partial differential
equations. Some subsequent developments are then discussed, including recent literature related to the von Neumann
condition, some irreversible schemes, generalizations of the energy method, some new difference schemes, and mixed
initial boundary value problems.<BR>
