<FONT SIZE="5">Computational Problem</FONT></H2>
<P>When developing computational methods for time-dependent PDE's it is very useful to be able to view plots of
the solutions at different times. The purpose of the computational part of the first assignment is to have you
run a sample code and either view plots of the solution as it is computed (for those who decide to use the CAMgraphics
classes) or view plots created from data files after it has run. If you are using Visual C++, documentation to
help you set up a Win32 Console Projects to run the assignments is available from the <A HREF="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~anderson/UsingVCPP7/index.html">UsingVCPP7</A>
web page. <BR>
<BR>
<B>For those who <I>are not</I> using the CAMgraphics classes </B><BR>
<BR>
[1] Download the sample &quot;main&quot; routine <A HREF="Assign1.cpp">Assign1.cpp</A> and the required support
files <A HREF="ExactPeriodicSolution.h">ExactPeriodicSolution.h</A>, <A HREF="../CPPcodes/DoubleArray1D.h">DoubleArray1D.h
</A>, and <A HREF="../CPPcodes/ProfileOutput.h">OutputProfile.h</A>. Compile and run the code. Create plots of
the output files, and turn in a plot of the solution corresponding to time t = 2.25.<BR>
<BR>
<B>For those who <I>are</I> using the CAMgraphics classes <BR>
</B><BR>
[0] Download and unzip the CAMgraphics support files contained in <A HREF="../CPPcodes/CAMgraphics.zip">CAMgraphics.zip</A>.
CAMgraphics.zip contains a subdirectory <B>camgraph</B> that<BR>
contains all of the required support files and a .lib file containing compiled executable. <BR>
<BR>
[1] Create a Win32 Console Project (not a Console Application) with the settings described below. Download and
insert into this project the sample &quot;main&quot; routine <A HREF="Assign1g.cpp">Assign1g.cpp</A> and the required
support files <A HREF="ExactPeriodicSolution.h">ExactPeriodicSolution.h</A>, <A HREF="../CPPcodes/DoubleArray1D.h">DoubleArray1D.h
</A>. Compile and run the program. As the program runs it will stop at the output times and a dialog will appear
with a plot of the solution. To continue, hit the continue button. If you want hardcopy, select print or specify
a file to contain the output. Turn in a plot of the solution corresponding to time t = 2.25.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000099">Required Project Settings and Support Files To Use CAMgraphics:</FONT><B><BR>
</B><BR>
A program that uses the CAMgraphics display requires project settings that are different than the default settings. Specifically, you use a Win32 Console Project with the following additional entries and settings
<UL>
	<LI>Specify the use of MFC in a DLL (<A HREF="../../UsingVCPP7/SpecifyingMFC/index.html">How To V7</A>)
	<LI>Specify the use of the<B> debug multi-threaded dll </B>runtime library (<A HREF="../../UsingVCPP7/SpecifyingDebugMTDLL/index.html">How
	to V7</A>)
	<LI>Disable the use of pre-compiled headers (PCH's).(<A HREF="../../UsingVCPP7/DisablingPCH/index.html">How To V7</A>)
	<LI>Add to your include path the location of the subdirectory <B><I>camgraph</I></B> containing the header files
	for CAMgraphics. (<A HREF="../../UsingVCPP7/SettingIncludePath/index.html">How To V7</A>)
	<LI>Add the startup file (from from subdirectory camgraph) <B>CAMstartup.cpp </B>to your project.
	<LI>Add the library file (from from subdirectory camgraph) <B>VC7Graphics.lib</B> to your project. The .lib files
	will not show up in the file chooser dialog unless you specify file types *.* (arrgh!).
	<LI>Add the resource (from from subdirectory camgraph) <B>DisplayDialog.rc </B>to your project.
</UL>

<P>Notes : The graphics display dialog may appear behind other windows, to make it visible, select the MSVC display
icon from the bottom menu bar.</P>
<H2>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER">
<A NAME="What"></A>What You Should Turn In</H2>

<UL>
	<LI>Answers to the theoretical problems.
	<LI>A plot of the solution at t = 2.25 created by the sample program.
</UL>
